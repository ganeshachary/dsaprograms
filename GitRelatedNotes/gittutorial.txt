first to create any git folder machine
    1. make a folder
    2. add files
    3. git init // command to initialize the folder for git

-> git init

-> git status :  to check status of files
     =  untracked or tracked 


// once done or reached mile stone add worked files for staging

-> git add filename.extensiong eg - git add index.html

// stage all files
 
-> git add --all // this will add to stagging but not commitet
                    //  git add --all is git add -A // shorthand


 // after staging we need to commit, git treats each commit as save point.

 -> git commit -m "This adds all the files to the git"    // -m "" is for adding message to commit      


-> git status --short  // this command shows the status in short status flags 

output.
 M index.html 

//Short status flags are:

//?? - Untracked files
//A - Files added to stage
//M - Modified files
//D - Deleted files     


-> git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line" // -a will also do staging and commit no need for separate staging step


-> git log  // history of the commit

-> git commit -help // used for manual of command


// branch 
//when u want to do some new changes not needed in current code, create a new branch and merge it with main branch later


->git branch newbranch1   // commamd and name of branch

->git branch  // shows the current branch pointed to

// to change the branch use checkout

-> git checkout newbranch1   /  // make changes and add staging and commit as per need using above commandgit 
                             // Using the -b option on checkout will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exist


// after changes done commit the current branch go to master

-> git checkout master

// merge the branch 

->git merge newbranch1   // this will merege the changes or adding of new branch to master if no changes done to same file it will siimply fastforwar point new bracnh as master
                            //if not it will show the error and we can fix it by updating the file and check the git status to find the issue and fixes;


-> git branch -d newbranch1 // delete the branch after merge if its not longer required.
